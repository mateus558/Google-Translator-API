# Google Translator API

This project aims to create a c++ library for communication with the google translator API. It makes possible to make 
requests for translations for the API supported languages.

The need for this library comes from another project that I'm working on where I've needed
to translate sentences, I haven't found libraries supporting requests for the google translate API,
so I've decided to write it on my own.

# Code Example

In the example bellow the API key is being provided from a file, for that 
you need to pass the file name and set a flag indicating that its a file, otherwise,
the library will understand that the key is being passed directly.

You can generate your API key following the instructions on [Google Cloud guide](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/setup).

**main.cpp**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <gtranslator/gtranslator.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
    gtranslator::GTranslator translator("key", true);
    
    std::cout << translator.translate("olÃ¡ mundo", "pt", "en");
    
    return 0;
}
```
**compile and run:**
```
g++ main.cpp -o main -lgtranslator
./main
```

**output:**
```
Hello World
```
